# Arduino/Nucleo shield with two Mikrobus slots with Grove connectors

Arduino pinout with
* 2 Mikrobus slots
* 2 Grove UART connectors ([UART2](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F446RE/), [UART4](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F446RE/))
* 2 Grove I2C connectors
* 2 Grove GPIO connectors
* 1 footprint for an [OpenLog breakout](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/openlog-hookup-guide) with 90Â° female header ([UART2](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F446RE/) RX only)
* 1 footprint for CAN (ISO 11898-2) driver ([L9616](https://www.st.com/en/automotive-analog-and-power/l9616.html)) on [CAN1](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F446RE/) and 1 footprint for optional CAN bus terminator (120 Ohm)
* 1 footprint for CAN H and CAN L connector.

> NB: Grove connectors are optional and can be soldered when a Mikrobus slot is unused.
